William Safire's rules for writing as seen in the New York Times

   Do not put statements in the negative form.
   And don't start sentences with a conjunction.
   If you reread your work, you will find on rereading that a great
   deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.
   Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.
   Unqualified superlatives are the worst of all.
   If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.
   Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.
   Never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
   Also, avoid awkward or affected alliteration.
   Last, but not least, avoid cliches like the plague.
