# QuoteLock

[Displays quotes on your lockscreen, because why not.](http://i.imgur.com/EXzpNWA.jpg)

**Only near-AOSP Android ROMs are supported!** This is due to the heavy lockscreen
modifications made by different OEMs.

**After installing, please open the app at least once** to allow the quote downloader service
to run in the background.

**Make sure to whitelist QuoteLock if you are using a task-killer app!** They can interfere
with the download service.
